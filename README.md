# bitwig-studio-stuff

I am using [Bitwig Studio](https://www.bitwig.com/) under Linux (openSUSE
Tumbleweed and Debian testing). This repo contains tools to sync my bitwig
installations, tools related to bitwig studio and my presets.

## Tools

### bw-encode

Right now bitwig studio only exports audio as wav files without any metadata. 
This script encodes such a wav file to mp3/ogg-vorbis and adds metadata.
